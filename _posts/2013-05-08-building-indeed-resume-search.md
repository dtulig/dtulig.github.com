I dive into the architecture of Indeedâ€™s Resume Instant Search and our use of the Google Closure tools. I explain how we write maintainable, efficient JavaScript components for Resume Instant Search and other Indeed products. I discuss how we create templates that run on both client and server, providing fast initial page load time and search engine-friendly pages with the responsiveness of client-side rendering.

This talk was given at [@IndeedEng](http://engineering.indeed.com/blog/2013/05/may-indeedeng-talk/), Indeed's public tech talk series.
