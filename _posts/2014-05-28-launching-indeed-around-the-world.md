Indeed launched its first job search site in 2004, allowing job seekers to find jobs in the US. Three years later, we launched our first non-US site. Over the next 5 years, we expanded to more than 50 countries and 27 languages. In this talk we will share our experience iteratively expanding Indeed to these new markets, and explain how you can use data to drive the business and product decisions involved in these launches. We will also describe the engineering and operational infrastructure we built to succeed worldwide.

This talk was given at [@IndeedEng](http://engineering.indeed.com/talks/internationalize-success/), Indeed's public tech talk series.
