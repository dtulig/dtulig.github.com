This talk will start by going over the components of the Google Closure Tools and will cover the templates, which are usable on both the client and server, the library, which comes with a dependency management system and a large set of utilities, and the compiler, which performs advanced optimizations to speed up your JavaScript and reduce the size of the final application. It then goes into detail on how Indeed has leveraged those tools to build resume instant search, covering using the closure tools in development, discussing the architecture that drives the product, and the advantages gained by using the closure tools.

This talk was given at [Austin JavaScript](http://austinjavascript.com/august-2012-austin-javascript-meetup-details-announced/).
